# Polytope4D
Do yo know Blender 3D, 3Ds Max and others? They limits you in 3 dimentions. Polytope 4D can stop it and help you create your own 4D model and use it as you need. When 4D engine will be created (by me, of course), you can create 4D games like Miegakure (but faster, Miegakure is in development for ~10 years).  
# Demo
Here you can see how 3D sphere will look in 4D space:

And well-known tesseract:

GIF has a poor quality, let's take a look at these beautiful screenshots:

You can try it yourself:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JavaharlalN/Polytope4D.git
cd Polytope4D
git checkout feature/32-add-menu
cargo run
```
Then select the tesseract or 3D sphere and click the ![](https://github.com/JavaharlalN/Polytope4D/blob/develop/sprites/logo.png?raw=true) button if you need to see a list of hotkeys.  
If your monitor resolution is differs from 1366x768, the menu may look bad. This bug will be fixed in the next refactor.
